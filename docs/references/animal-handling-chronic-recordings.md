**Handling and Injections Procedure**

1. Turn on computer monitors (ON button is located on the lower right for the horizontal monitor and upper right for the vertical monitor).
2. Wiggle the mouse to wake up the computer. The computer should not require a password, but if it does, the password is **Imitation-Unwoven-Taps5**.
3. Turn on the audio to listen to neural activity by:

  i. Click “CONNECT” (red box) in the Open Ephys GUI window on the right monitor.

  ii. Press play (red box in the image below) in the same window. You should now hear neural activity, which sounds like popping/crackling, and see traces updating from left to right in the “LFP “window located in the above window. **This popping sound is diagnostic of whether the implant on the head is physically sound. If, while handling the animal, the sound suddenly turns off or you hear a loud buzz, it means the implant has just been damaged, and this may cause the closed loop system to crash. Contact us immediately in that case so that we can re-launch.**

4. Open the door to the box and secure it open with one of the attached pieces of tape. **Note that the box has no floor (sitting on top of the white or black plastic base), so please be careful not to push or pull against the box as it may tip over. It is best practice to lightly pull against the enclosure’s door while supporting the box with a hand. The box should also be aligned to the two pieces of tape that denotes where one of the corners of the box should be.**
5. Move the table/platform in front of the now open box.
6. Place the upside-down cage lid on top of the table/platform.
7. Ground yourself and discharge any built up static electricity by touching exposed skin on your wrist to a screw on the big metal tower.
8. Grab the mouse by the tail while **avoiding at all costs** touching the head gear (“chef’s hat”) orthe wire (make sure not to tangle it). Place the mouse on the upside-down cage lid. **Please do not touch the mouse above its shoulders**.
9. Injections should be given near the hip of the mouse. **Please avoid grabbing or touching the mouse above its shoulders.**
10. To weigh the mouse you can place a scale on top of the table/platform. **Please use only battery-operated scales**_;_ plugging in power source for the non-battery-operated scale may cause electrical noise and could crash the system controlling the closed loop.
11. Return the mouse to the box while preventing the wire from getting tangled with the mouse. Placing the mouse on the palm of the hand seems to work well.
12. Gently close the door to the box. If the door sticks a little while trying to close it, carefully push it closed while supporting the box so that it doesn’t tip.
13. Turn off the audio by pressing the play button again in the Open Ephys GUI (it will be yellow while it’s playing, and it should turn from yellow to white when you press it). Then press “DISCONNECT”.
14. Turn off the monitors by pressing the buttons in step 1 again.
15. Observe the mouse and the system to ensure that everything looks normal.
